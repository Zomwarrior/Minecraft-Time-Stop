# Minecraft-Time-Stop
A Minecraft datapack that adds Stopping Time

To add this datapack to your game, place the zip file called "TimeStop-0.0.1" directly into the datapacks folder of your world

To activate stopped time, look directly downwards and press sneak (There is an invisible cooldown of 1 minute)

The datapack is currently not very multiplayer compatible at the moment
